# WriteWise

WriteWise is a lightweight writing assistant designed for startup teams and solo builders who want clear, thoughtful content without over-polished marketing fluff.

It helps you:
- Brainstorm meaningful blog ideas
- Draft complete blog posts
- Refine rough or unfinished content

All with a natural, human tone that feels edited — not automated.

## 🧠 How it works

WriteWise uses a modern large language model served via a cloud API.  
The prompts and UI are carefully designed to reduce generic AI phrasing and produce writing that feels natural and human-edited.

The app is built with:
- Streamlit (UI)
- Groq API (LLM backend)
- Python (core logic)
